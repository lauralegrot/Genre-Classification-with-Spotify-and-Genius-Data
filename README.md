# ðŸŽ¶ Genre-Classification-with-Spotify-and-Genius-Data ðŸŽ¶
## Final project for Statistical methods for high dimensional data course at UniPD
### Project description 
Music streaming services, such as Spotify, continuously add new content that must be accurately labeled and classified by genre. Given the vast amount of data, manually assigning genres to each new song is impractical. Instead, machine learning models can be employed to automatically perform genre classification, especially in large-scale contexts. 

This project focuses on leveraging statistical methods and a neural network approach to classify song genresâ€”Pop, Rap, and Rockâ€”using data from Spotify's audio features and Genius lyrics, both scraped via their respective APIs.

The final dataset consists of 2,285 songs with 13,354 predictors, encompassing both audio features and unigrams from the TF-IDF matrix of the lyrics data. This combination enables the exploration of how text and audio features contribute to genre classification.
